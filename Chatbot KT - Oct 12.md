## Web Integration
Three Step Process. 
1. Exposing Chatbot as an API
2. Creating sample html file to listen API queries
3. Understand different types of response types and render them accordingly in the web app

1. Exposed API with rasa run --enable-api --cors "*" --debug
2. We have debugged the API query info with postman
3. Understand the response types.
